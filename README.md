#Node.js CMS & Web Application Platform
The open source framework for developing database-driven websites, applications and APIs in Node.js. Built on Express and MongoDB.


##Express.js and MongoDB

CMS will configure express - the de facto web server for node.js - for you and connect to your MongoDB database using Mongoose, the leading ODM package.

##Dynamic Routes

CMS starts with best practices for setting up your MV* application, and makes it easy to manage your templates, views and routes.

##Database Fields

IDs, Strings, Booleans, Dates and Numbers are the building blocks of your database. CMS builds on these with useful, real-world field types like name, email, password, address, image and relationship fields (and more)

##Auto-generated Admin UI

Whether you use it while you're building out your application, or in production as a database content management system, CMS's Admin UI will save you time and make managing your data easy.

##Simpler Code

Sometimes, async code can get complicated to do simple things. CMS helps keep simple things - like loading data before displaying it in a view - simple.

##Form Processing

Want to validate a form, upload an image, and update your database with a single line? CMS can do that, based on the data models you've already defined.

##Session Management

CMS comes ready out of the box with session management and authentication features, including automatic encryption for password fields.

##Email Sending

CMS makes it easy to set up, preview and send template-based emails for your application. It also integrates with Mandrill (Mailchimp's excellent transaction email sending service)
